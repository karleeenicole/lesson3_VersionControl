            <p class="lead">A Version Control System is a system used for backing up files. Its used for the purpose of recovering and modifying previous versions of a file. It is very useful when working on a large project with several people contributing (often simultaneously). A VCS solves the file sharing issue by utilizing a main common repository allowing team members to checkout, edit, commit, and merge files. It comes in handy when one wants to save a current version of a file that they may want to revert back to. The system keeps track of what exact changes were made by who and when. They are very smart to use in case of a mistake the system holds backups.</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">GIT is a leading Version Control System that is known as distributed version control. This is a system that allows users to check out the fully repository and history, not just the latest version of the file. This is a better system because if the server goes down, all is not lost and clients can back up the entire repository. This is different from a centralized system because the version database each person is working with allows for complete range of motion for working on the project in large capacity. GIT is fast, simple, and fully distributed for large projects to be easily maintained between and across branches. </p>

                <li>The first step is to create an account on GitHub.</li>
                <li>Next, configure a public key to use SSH remotes by clicking on "Settings" -> "Add an SSH key"</li>
                <li>Paste the contents of your public-key and click "Add key."</li>
                <li>Add your email address and two-factor authentication if wanted.</li>
                <li>Next you'll need to obtain a git repository. This can be done by taking a local directory that isn't under a VCS and put it under Git, or clone an existing Git repository from somewhere else. </li>
                <li>Go to the project directory "$ cd /Users/user/my_project" and type "$ git init"</li>
                <li>This creates a subdirectory named ".git" (a skeleton).</li>
                <li>Next we'll go over the git commands for navigating the system.</li>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">It can get confusing understanding the locations of files with adding, committing, and pushing, but Git does a clear job of keeping it straight. Remote and local repositories are confusing concepts. In the local directory is your working directory, staging area, and local repo. Things are placed into the local repo when they are committed. They are placed into the staging area when they are added. Git push places a file into the remote repo. Git pull is used to pull it back from the remote repo to local workspace. Where git checkout places it back into the working directory from the local repo. The remote repo is only involved in git push and git pull. The concept are easier to visualize when mapped out.</p>
